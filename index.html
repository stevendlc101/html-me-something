            <h2>The Lines</h2>
                <p>The script of Casablanca is extermely well written. In additon,
                    it contains many memorable lines of dialog, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine."" </li>
                        <li>"We'll always have Paris."</li>
                        <li>"Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon. And for the rest of your life."</li>
                        <li>"It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount 
                            to a hill of beans in this crazy world."</li>
                        <li>"Here's looking at you kid."</li>
                        <li>"Round up the usual suspects."</li>
                        <li> ...and perhaps the most mis-quoted movie line in history: 
                            "Play it, Sam. Play As Time Goes By"</li>

            <h3>The Song</h3>
                <p> As Time Goes By has grown to be as iconic a song as Casablanca has grown to be
                    an iconic film. It captures the pain and sweetness of an unrequited love. While
                    Dooley Wilson (who played Sam) received the honor of playing the song in the film,
                    many artist have covered the song throught the past 70 plus years.
